# FourteenRoses
A Flask app website at www.fourteenroses.space to contain and ditribute my girlfriend's writtings.

Feel free for reproduction and distribution of the code under the Flask Licence any writings contained in the database and hosted on the website are under general creative copywrite and my Katie Brethorst would be more than happy to talk about her writings if you would like to contact her at phanofpanic14@gmail.com 

Any concerns about the code or to contact me feel free at stockwellbob@hotmail.com

This App
Created using Flask and a special thanks to Miguel Grinberg for his Flask Mega Tutorial for the guidance in its conception and for his flask-migrate package which is very convient for someone's first experience. Tutuorials like his allow people to learn things effectivally without formal guidance and contribute to a more educated public.
